# Youtube Recommendations Blocker

A simple Browser Addon that greys out Youtube recommendations to keep you from getting distracted.

## Install

The latest release is available for Firefox on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/developers/addon/yt-recommendations-blocker/).

To instead run a copy of this project locally, got to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click on "load temporary addon" and select one of the files in the source folder. The addon will then be installed until you restart the browser again (or remove it again using the same page).

## Compatibility

This is a WebExtension, so it should work in most modern browsers - I've only tested it in firefox though.
Feel free to upload this to other browser addon marketplaces, such as the chrome web store, but please link back to the this or a forked github repository if you do so.
If there are any compatibility issues that you know how to fix, feel free to open a pull request and I'll see if I can add it to the repository.

## Contributing

If you find any bugs or have any feature requests, just open an issue or pull request here or [send me an email](mailto:peabrainiac@web.de).
I don't have much experience with open source projects, so sorry for being sort of vague here - if you have any questions or want to contribute something, it's probably best to just send me an email using the link above.
